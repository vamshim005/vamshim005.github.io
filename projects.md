An end-to-end Deep Learning platform that allows users to create, train, and deploy their own neural network models in a matter of minutes without writing a single line of code.

The platform supports two types of tasks:

1. **Image Classification**  
   Classify images from your own dataset by using them to train a ResNet-34 or MobileNet v2 model. Training happens via transfer learning where models available will be pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Predict sentiment from sentences by training a LSTM or GRU based sequential model on your own dataset. The models will be trained from scratch.

**Tools Used**: Python, PyTorch, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3)

## Topic Based Image Captioning

<a href="https://github.com/shan18/Topic-Based-Image-Captioning" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-blue"></a>

An automatic image caption generation system built using Deep Learning.

- Devised a novel image captioning model using CNNs and LSTMs trained on MSCOCO-2017 Dataset.
- Created a system where LSTMs were given additional information (topics) extracted from image captions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

**Tools Used**: Python, Tensoflow, NLTK, OpenCV

## Autoranking Amazon Reviews

<a href="https://github.com/shan18/Autoranking-Amazon-Reviews" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-blue"></a>

Ranking the reviews on Amazon according to their helpfulness score.

- The problem was modeled as a regression problem. The performance was evaluated by using the coefficient of determination and rank correlation.
- Predictions were made based on various categories of features of the review text, and other metadata associated with the review, with the purpose of generating a rank for a given list of reviews.

**Tools Used**: Python, Numpy, Pandas, textblob, scikit-learn
