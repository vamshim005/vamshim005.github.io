- **Goal:** Identify high-demand zones, surface as GeoJSON/Plotly maps
- **Stack:** Python, PySpark, Docker, AWS EMR, Plotly, FastAPI, GitHub Actions
- **Results:** 4 min end-to-end refresh on $1 EMR cluster, 18% simulated efficiency gain
- **Features:** One-command reproducibility, CI/CD, interactive visualizations
