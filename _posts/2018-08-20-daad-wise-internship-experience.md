I was thrilled to receive the offer to join DXC Technologies as a Software Engineering Intern during my final year of studies. With a passion for building real-world applications and improving system performance, this internship gave me an incredible opportunity to contribute to enterprise-scale projects from day one.

My primary responsibility was to develop a mobile application called Melange — an Android-based platform designed to manage offsite events. Built using Java and Firebase, the app handled everything from event schedules and hotel room allocations to real-time notifications and reminders. It felt rewarding to see my code come to life in a tool used internally by teams across DXC.

Another key part of my internship involved backend modernization. I was tasked with migrating legacy SOAP APIs to RESTful services using Spring, which led to a 25% improvement in system throughput and an 18% reduction in response time. This transition wasn't easy at first, but it gave me hands-on experience in Spring's ecosystem and helped me understand the importance of scalable API design.

Alongside backend work, I improved the frontend experience using HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery. These changes significantly enhanced the UI's responsiveness and the overall user experience for client-facing modules.

One of the most satisfying aspects of the internship was automating reporting dashboards in Tableau. By translating high-level business requirements into clear visual insights, I helped save more than 13 hours of manual work every week. I also worked on multithreaded implementations to optimize server-side tasks and integrated unit testing with Jest to ensure code reliability.

My experience with Spring Data JPA and JDBC taught me the importance of structured data access and clean integration with relational databases. These technologies not only improved performance but also introduced me to clean coding practices and reusable patterns.

The culture at DXC was collaborative and growth-oriented. I had weekly sync-ups with mentors, learned to work with Agile sprints, and regularly participated in code reviews. This constant feedback loop helped me become a better engineer, both technically and professionally.

Looking back, this internship laid a strong foundation for my career. It helped me grow into a more confident developer, equipped me with industry-grade tools, and gave me the satisfaction of building something meaningful.
